# Summary
I was trying to find something that would:
1. Display children of a custom menu on the parent page. 
2. Siblings of a custom menu on sub pages.

This is what I came up with... I am sure it could probably be done cleaner.
Enjoy.  

## Usage
Insert this wherever you want to display your menu.
Adjust the code structure to suit your build (eg. <ul><li> etc)


# Bugs.
There is a bug on the 'current-menu' class when using custom post types as the parent menu.
